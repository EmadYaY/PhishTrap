## üß† Idea Behind the Tool

This tool simulates a **real-world initial access scenario** via a weaponized Windows Server and an `.rdp` file. It's made for **Red Team operations**, adversary emulation, or lab experiments.

> **Goal:** Trick users into enabling drive sharing through RDP and silently plant a payload for post-exploitation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User connects** to a remote server using the provided `.rdp` file.
2. A **custom server-side application** launches and forces the Windows environment into a **kiosk-style lockdown**:
   - Disables all key combinations: `Alt+Tab`, `Ctrl+Alt+Del`, `Win key`, etc.
   - Prevents user from interacting with the real desktop.

3. A **fake security prompt** is displayed:
   - If **Drive Sharing** is already enabled, the tool moves to the next stage.
   - If **not**, the user is shown a warning suggesting a "security feature" must be enabled, tricking them into turning on sharing.

4. When sharing is enabled, the tool:
   - Gains access to the local user's system via `\\tsclient`
   - Plants a **payload in the Startup folder** for persistence or further execution
